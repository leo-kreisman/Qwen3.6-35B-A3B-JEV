ABSTRACT

Hybrid linear-attention architectures have recently scaled to large open-weight
models, offering quality competitive with full attention while substantially reduc-
ing key/value (KV) cache growth. However, their in-place recurrent-state updates
complicate cache management: prefix reuse requires state checkpoints alongside
full-attention KV, while storing state checkpoints in full increases memory pres-
sure, leading to more evictions and repeated prefill. By analyzing the decay struc-
ture of Gated DeltaNet (GDN) and Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), we find that
different heads and channels retain prefix information over markedly different
timescales, which we term retention horizons. This variation suggests substan-
tial compression potential in persistent state checkpoints. Building on this ob-
servation, we introduce Decay-Aware State Compression (DASC), which derives
retention horizons from model weights, selects long-horizon state units, and packs
them into a ragged state checkpoint layout. To integrate efficiently with tensor-
parallel inference engines, DASC furtherly balances compressed state checkpoints
across TP ranks. On reuse, DASC either zero-fills omitted units or refreshes them
from a bounded suffix with additional compute cost. Across retrieval and end-
to-end reasoning benchmarks on Kimi-Linear, conservative DASC configurations
remain close to full caching while compressing KDA recurrent state checkpoints
by 2.63×. Under fixed state checkpoint memory budgets, the resulting capac-
ity gains reduce mean Time to First Token (TTFT) by 42.6% and improve input
throughput by 68.4%. At larger compression ratio, suffix refresh recovers much
of the accuracy lost to more aggressive omission, at the cost of additional replay
computation. Qwen with GDN exhibits a similar quality–efficiency trend, show-
ing that DASC extends from channel-wise KDA to head-wise GDN.

INTRODUCTION

Hybrid linear-attention architectures now underpin trillion-parameter open-weight models, includ-
ing Qwen3.8-2.4T-A95B and the 2.8T-parameter Kimi K3 (Qwen Team, 2026; Kimi Team, 2026).
These models interleave full-attention layers with linear-attention layers that summarize the prefix in
fixed-size recurrent states. This hybrid design retains strong model quality while slowing key/value
(KV) cache growth. However, its in-place recurrent-state updates introduce a new challenge for
prefix caching.

Unlike full-attention KV, a recurrent state is overwritten as tokens arrive and does not preserve ear-
lier prefix boundaries. Prefix caching therefore materializes full state checkpoints at regular token
intervals alongside KV blocks (Zheng et al., 2024; Dao, 2026). Because each state checkpoint con-
tains large state matrices for all linear-attention layers, frequent state checkpointing quickly exhausts
HBM, while sparse state checkpointing increases replay or repeated prefill. This tension makes it
important to determine which state units must be retained at each state checkpoint.

Figure 1: Overview of DASC. Weight-derived retention horizons select long-horizon state units,
which are packed into TP-balanced ragged state checkpoints. On reuse, omitted units are either
zero-filled or refreshed from a bounded suffix.

Our analysis reveals a structured answer: recurrent-state units have widely different retention hori-
zons. Many forget distant tokens quickly, while a smaller subset remains persistent. This varia-
tion follows the model architecture, appearing across heads in Gated DeltaNet (GDN) and across
channels in Kimi Delta Attention (KDA). Moreover, the decay parameters stored in model weights
provide an input-independent estimate of these horizons. We validate this signal against observed
token-dependent decay, state magnitudes, and readout contributions. Causal ablations further show
why selection must be conservative: recurrent states can be redundant for simple recall yet remain
important for multi-key, aggregation, and reasoning tasks.

We translate these findings into Decay-Aware State Compression (DASC). Before serving, DASC
constructs a static selection plan that retains long-horizon heads for GDN or channels for KDA.
At runtime, the selected units are flat-packed into ragged state checkpoints, balanced across tensor-
parallel ranks, and integrated into the radix-cache store and load paths; full-attention KV remains
unchanged. On a cache hit, DASC-NR zero-fills omitted units and adds no model computation,
whereas DASC-WR can spend additional compute to refresh them from a bounded suffix. This sep-
aration makes the common path inexpensive while providing a recovery mechanism when more
aggressive compression is worthwhile.

We evaluate both the selection signal and its serving consequences on Qwen3-Next and Kimi-
Linear (Qwen Team, 2025; Kimi Team, 2025). At a conservative KDA threshold, ragged storage
fits 2.63× as many recurrent state checkpoints within the same state-memory budget while remain-
ing close to full-cache quality across retrieval and end-to-end tasks. Under a fixed state checkpoint
memory budget, this higher cache residency reduces mean Time to First Token (TTFT) by 42.6%
and improves input throughput by 68.4% on Kimi-Linear. At more aggressive thresholds, suffix
refresh recovers much of the accuracy lost through omission at the cost of additional replay com-
putation. Qwen3-Next exhibits a similar quality–efficiency trend, showing that DASC extends from
channel-wise KDA to head-wise GDN.

Our contributions are:

• We characterize decay heterogeneity in GDN and KDA recurrent states and define weight-derived
retention horizons as an input-independent signal for selecting state units.
• We design and implement DASC in SGLang. It selects long-horizon units, packs them into ragged
state checkpoints, balances compressed state checkpoints across TP ranks, and supports either
zero-fill or bounded-suffix refresh on reuse.

RELATED WORK

Linear attention and hybrid architectures.
Linear attention and state-space models replace
the context-length-dependent KV cache of softmax attention with a fixed-size recurrent state
(Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Gu & Dao, 2023; Dao & Gu, 2024). Delta-rule and gated variants
add content-dependent updates and adaptive decay (Yang et al., 2024b;a), while hybrid models in-
terleave recurrent and full-attention layers to retain exact token retrieval (Lieber et al., 2024; Ren
et al., 2024; Kimi Team, 2025). Unlike architecture and training work, we study how the resulting
recurrent states should be represented in a serving-time prefix cache.

Prefix caching and full-attention KV management.
SGLang’s RadixAttention organizes shared
prefixes in a radix tree, while vLLM’s PagedAttention provides block-grained KV allocation and
reuse (Zheng et al., 2024; Kwon et al., 2023). Hierarchical systems extend reusable KV across GPU
and host memory (Gao et al., 2024; Jin et al., 2024); quantization, eviction, and sparsification further
reduce token-indexed KV storage (Hooper et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023; Xiao
et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024). These methods are complementary to DASC, which leaves full-attention
KV unchanged and compresses the recurrent state checkpoint stored alongside it.

Hybrid recurrent-state prefix caching and replay.
Processing a prefix through a recurrent layer
produces one boundary state summarizing all preceding tokens, so reuse requires storing that state
or recomputing it. Kimi K3 persists KDA states for prefix reuse (Kimi Team, 2026); Marconi
instead improves which hybrid prefix entries are admitted and evicted based on reuse and compute–
memory utility (Pan et al., 2025). ReplaySSM caches recent SSM inputs and reconstructs states
on demand, targeting decode-time state traffic and rollback (Dao, 2026). DASC changes a different
axis—the representation size of each persistent boundary state checkpoint—so it can complement
entry-management and replay policies.

RETENTION HETEROGENEITY IN HYBRID RECURRENT STATES

This section first uses a controlled cache ablation to identify task-specific redundancy in recurrent
state checkpoints. The decay structure of GDN and KDA then motivates a weight-derived, input-
independent metric for estimating retention horizons. Empirical validation confirms its reliability
for unit selection, providing the basis for DASC.

3.1
RECURRENT STATES IN HYBRID PREFIX CACHES

A gated delta-rule layer summarizes the processed sequence in a recurrent state St ∈Rdv×dk, which
a query reads as ot = Stqt. KDA updates this state as

St = St−1 Diag(αt)
�
I −βtktk⊤
t
�
+ βt vtk⊤
t ,
αt ∈(0, 1)dk,
(1)

where αt controls input-dependent forgetting and βt the update strength (Kimi Team, 2025). The
three terms attenuate the old state, remove content aligned with kt, and write the new key–value
association. Earlier, GDN parameterized gated decay per head (Yang et al., 2024a); KDA increases
this granularity by exposing channel-wise decay within each head.

Unlike full attention, a delta-rule layer carries only this fixed-size state forward. Reusing prefix p
therefore requires both exact full-attention KV and each recurrent layer’s boundary state S(l)(p). In
prefix caching, each reusable prefix requires its own recurrent state checkpoint; if the state check-
point is not cached, the state must be recomputed through prefill.

3.2
RECURRENT STATE CHECKPOINTS CONTAIN TASK-SPECIFIC REDUNDANCY

We probe these two cache components on RULER NIAH-S1 using five needle depths and N =
100 examples per depth. For Qwen3-Next-80B and Kimi-Linear-48B, we cache the shared prefix
and zero its full-attention KV, recurrent state checkpoints, both, or neither before reuse. Every
intervention reuses the same fully cached prefix, so any accuracy difference comes from the zeroed
cache component rather than from differences in cache hits.

Removing full-attention KV reduces accuracy to zero, whereas removing recurrent state checkpoints
changes it by at most one point (Table 1(a)). This single-key result exposes compression headroom in
recurrent state checkpoints and motivates evaluation on harder multi-key, aggregation, and reasoning
tasks in §5.2.

3.3
STATIC HORIZONS ENABLE INPUT-INDEPENDENT SELECTION

The intervention reveals compression headroom but not which state units should be retained. Al-
though the input-dependent decay gate provides a natural retention signal, collecting it for every
prompt would make the selection request-dependent. An offline serving plan instead requires a
fixed metric derived without calibration data.

To build this metric, we first consider the GDN parameterization of the log-decay g = log αt (Yang
et al., 2024a):
g = −exp(Alog) softplus(a + dtbias),
(2)

where Alog and dtbias are learned decay parameters and a is the input-dependent gate logit. For the
static metric, we fix a = −0.3, making g independent of the input. Because g < 0, the decay gate
attenuates information over η tokens by egη. We define the static retention horizon as the number of
tokens required for this decay factor to fall to ϵ:

Hs = ln ϵ

g .
(3)

We empirically set ϵ = 10−3 throughout our experiments. Compared with a = 0, choosing a =
−0.3 produces slower decay and longer horizons, deliberately biasing the metric toward retaining
more units.

The decay parameterization yields one Hs per head

shows broad KDA channel decay (median α = 0.471,
interquartile range (IQR) [0.170, 0.774]) but predom-
inantly slow GDN head decay (0.969, [0.894, 0.997]).
At a 16-token cutoff, 90.6% of KDA heads contain
channels on both sides, so head-level aggregation
would hide substantial variation. These profiles mo-
tivate head-wise selection for GDN and channel-wise
selection for KDA. Appendix Figures 4–6 give layer-
wise profiles.

3.4
WEIGHT-DERIVED HORIZONS TRACK OBSERVED DECAY

To test the weight-derived Hs against input-dependent behavior, we use 32 length-stratified
ShareGPT prefixes. For prefix p, recurrent layer l, and state unit u (a head in GDN or a key chan-
nel within a head in KDA), let Tp denote the non-padding token positions and gp,t,l,u the observed
log-decay of unit u at token t. Averaging over the prefix gives the empirical horizon

¯g(e)
p,l,u =
1
|Tp|

�

t∈Tp
gp,t,l,u,
H(e)
p,l,u = ln ϵ

¯g(e)
p,l,u
.
(4)

We also measure whether longer-horizon units carry more observed activity at the final prefix posi-
tion T. Suppressing prefix, layer, and time indices, let Sh denote a GDN head state and Sh,k a KDA
state channel. The state and final-query readout magnitudes are

MS(u) =
�∥Sh∥F ,
u = h (GDN),
∥Sh,k∥2,
u = (h, k) (KDA)
MR(u) =
�∥Shqh∥2,
u = h (GDN),
∥Sh,kqh,k∥2,
u = (h, k) (KDA).
(5)

For KDA, MR measures per-channel readout activity rather than its net contribution to the summed
output.

For each prefix–layer pair, we compute the Spearman rank correlation coefficient ρ across its heads
(GDN) or channels (KDA) between Hs and each of He, MS, and MR. Table 1(b) reports medians
and IQRs over 1,152 GDN and 640 KDA prefix–layer comparisons. The median Hs–He correlation
is 0.801 for GDN and 0.856 for KDA; the corresponding correlations with state magnitude are 0.632
and 0.533, and those with readout magnitude are 0.537 and 0.402. Thus Hs strongly preserves
empirical horizon ordering and is moderately associated with observed activity, supporting it as a
selection signal rather than a complete importance measure.

4
DECAY-AWARE STATE COMPRESSION

Using the weight-derived static horizons Hs introduced in §3, DASC constructs an input-independent
compression plan for recurrent state checkpoints. It retains long-horizon units, omits short-horizon
units from persistent storage, and optionally refreshes omitted units when a cached prefix is reused.
Figure 1 summarizes the resulting store and load paths.

4.1
DECAY-AWARE SELECTION AND STORAGE

DASC constructs a fixed selection mask by comparing each unit’s static horizon Hs(u) with a thresh-
old Wmax. A unit is global and retained when Hs(u) > Wmax; otherwise, it is local and omitted
from the persistent state checkpoint. Selection follows the architecture’s decay granularity: one
complete head state for GDN and one key channel (h, k), corresponding to S(l)
h,:,k, for KDA. Be-
cause Hs depends only on model weights, the mask is constructed once offline without calibration
prompts or online profiling.

Let L be the number of recurrent linear-attention layers, excluding full-attention layers, and let nl
and rl be the total and retained state-unit counts in layer l, respectively. A unit is one head in GDN
and one (head, k) channel in KDA. Units have equal cost within the temporal-state tensor, so ragged
storage keeps �

l rl temporal units instead of �

l nl. Recurrent state checkpoints use SGLang’s
default mixed precision: the temporal state is FP32 and the convolution state is BF16; BF16 model
execution is a separate setting. Let Btemp and Bconv denote their physical bytes. The temporal-only
and complete state checkpoint compression ratios are

Crag
temp =
�L
l=1 nl
�L
l=1 rl
,
Crag
ckpt = Bdense
temp + Bconv
Brag
temp + Bconv
.
(6)

Under a fixed full state checkpoint memory budget, Cckpt is the state checkpoint capacity multiplier.
A padded temporal layout reserves the largest retained count Rmax = maxl rl for every layer, even
though only rl entries are valid in layer l, giving Cpad
temp = (�

l nl)/(LRmax). The ragged layout
flat-packs each layer’s retained units with offsets. Defining r = L−1 �

l rl, its temporal compres-
sion is (�

l nl)/(Lr), and its layout gain over padded storage is Rmax/r. Reported capacity ratios
include the uncompressed BF16 convolution state and the per-rank TP bottleneck (Appendix B); the
gain is large for KDA’s imbalanced retained counts and modest for GDN’s more uniform profile.

4.2
LOAD POLICIES

On a cache hit, DASC loads the retained global units exactly. DASC-NR (the default) leaves omit-
ted local units at zero. DASC-WR instead replays a bounded suffix from a zero-initialized scratch
recurrent state and copies only the refreshed local units into the active state; the stored global state
checkpoint and cached full-attention KV remain unchanged. Let Llocal denote the omitted units.
Each unit’s horizon is rounded up to a power of two and clamped to [4, Wmax], and DASC-WR uses
the longest resulting window:

Wu = clamp(next pow2(Hs(u)), 4, Wmax)
Wreplay =
max
u∈Llocal Wu.
(7)

Increasing Wmax omits more units and improves state checkpoint compression, but can increase
DASC-NR approximation error and DASC-WR replay cost. DASC-WR remains approximate because
it does not recover local-state history preceding the replay window.

4.3
TP-BALANCED PLACEMENT

Tensor parallelism balances computation across ranks, but decay-aware selection can leave their
compressed state checkpoint payloads highly uneven. Let Ur denote the persistent-state payload on
rank r. Because a logical state checkpoint is sharded across all TP ranks, the number of resident
state checkpoints is limited by the most heavily loaded rank, maxr Ur.

DASC balances state checkpoint payloads in two stages. First, a model-load-time permutation redis-
tributes linear-attention head bundles across TP ranks. Applying the same permutation to all coupled
model tensors makes this an exact reindexing with no additional per-token communication. Second,
during state checkpoint storage, DASC treats the entire TP group as a shared storage pool and re-
distributes packed state units to balance the payload across ranks. Specifically, the target per-rank
slot width is C = ⌈�

r Ur/T⌉, where T is the TP degree. During STORE, a variable-split all-to-all
sends only remotely owned units; LOAD applies the inverse transfer before restoring the compute-
local state layout. Communication is therefore confined to state checkpoint store and load, while
recurrent prefill and decoding remain compute-local. Both balancing stages are exact and introduce
no additional approximation.

EXPERIMENTS

We evaluate DASC for quality, matched-HBM serving, and the accuracy–latency trade-off of suffix
refresh.

5.1
SETUP

Models and hardware.
We evaluate Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct, which contains 36 GDN
and 12 full-attention layers (Qwen Team, 2025), and Kimi-Linear-48B-A3B-Instruct, which con-
tains 20 KDA and 7 full-attention layers (Kimi Team, 2025). We refer to these models as Qwen-
GDN and Kimi-KDA, respectively, throughout the experiments and appendix. They expose decay
at head and channel granularity, respectively. All experiments run on Hopper-architecture GPUs.

Benchmarks.
Long-context quality is evaluated on all 13 RULER subtasks at 4k, 8k, and 16k
context lengths, with N = 30 instances per subtask–length setting (Hsieh et al., 2024). The end-
to-end suite covers mathematical reasoning with the MathArena releases of AIME 2026 Parts I and
II and HMMT February 2026 (Dekoninck et al., 2026), together with IMO-AnswerBench (Luong
et al., 2025); general reasoning with GPQA-Diamond (Rein et al., 2024) and MMLU-Pro (Wang
et al., 2024); and conversational memory with LoCoMo (Maharana et al., 2024).

Implementation and evaluation protocol.
We implement DASC in SGLang (Zheng et al., 2024).
All experiments use TP8; within one experiment, arms share requests and seeds. Model weights and
execution are unquantized BF16, while temporal/convolution states are FP32/BF16. Unless noted,
DASC-NR and ragged storage are used. Compression is relative to the dense mixed-precision state
checkpoint and excludes unchanged full-attention KV. Each subsection states its distinct cache-

5.2
QUALITY UNDER RECURRENT-STATE COMPRESSION

RULER fixes the slot count and averages three post-warmup replay rounds over N = 30 unique
instances. The single-needle diagnostic is saturated: dense and DASC-NR both score 1.000 for both
models at every tested Wmax. We therefore report the broader RULER retrieval, extraction, QA, and
tracking suite. Table 2 shows dense and ragged DASC-NR at Wmax = 16 and 1024; Appendix D
gives complete sweeps.

At Wmax = 16, Kimi-KDA scores 0.95/0.95/0.95 at 4k/8k/16k versus dense 0.95/0.96/0.95;
Qwen-GDN scores 0.84/0.83/0.81 versus 0.84/0.83/0.80.
Thus every displayed aggregate is
within 0.01 of dense. At Wmax = 1024, Kimi-KDA drops by 0.04/0.06/0.07, with the largest
16k losses on MK1, MV, CWE, and QA-S. Qwen-GDN aggregates remain within 0.01, although
MK3 falls from 1.00 to 0.87 at 16k. Section 5.4 evaluates suffix refresh.

End-task quality.
Unlike RULER, Table 3 uses normal concurrent serving; scores average re-
peated generations per problem without hit conditioning. It compares dense state checkpoints,
ragged DASC-NR, and count-matched Random. For each layer and Wmax, each of five fixed Random
masks uniformly retains the same number of units as DASC, holding compression fixed to isolate the

benefit of decay-aware ranking. Arms share the slot count, and the token-weighted hit rate is shown
once. At Wmax = 16, DASC remains within 1.3 percentage points of dense on every row. On
Kimi-KDA, it exceeds the five-mask Random mean in all 15 reasoning comparisons, with seven
remaining significant after Holm correction. Qwen-GDN remains within 1.7 points of dense, with
mixed DASC–Random differences. Appendix Table 5 gives complete Kimi-KDA paired inference.

Composition with state quantization.
Prior work shows
that recurrent states can be quantized alongside model
weights and activations (Tianqi et al., 2025). Quantization
reduces the bits per retained value, whereas DASC reduces
the number of retained units, making the two complemen-
tary. We combine Wmax = 16 channel selection, INT8 state
checkpoint storage, and DASC-NR on the five Kimi-KDA
end tasks, yielding 8.11× state checkpoint capacity relative
to the dense mixed-precision reference. Appendix E.2 gives
the protocol.

MATCHED-HBM SERVING

Matched-HBM serving uses a controlled MMLU-Pro-derived prefix-reuse workload, ragged stor-
age, and a fixed complete per-rank state checkpoint budget including temporal and convolution
state; only the state checkpoint configuration varies. Figure 3 connects the resulting compression to
serving performance.

With workload and HBM fixed, extra slots arise only from fewer bytes per state checkpoint.

State checkpoint capacity.
Figure 3(a,d) shows that compression depends on selection granular-
ity. With TP-balanced placement, channel-wise KDA achieves 2.63–28.04× compression across

8


DASC: Decay-Aware State Compression for Hybrid Linear-Attention Serving

Wmax = 16–512, while head-wise GDN achieves 1.10–2.48×. TP balancing improves both by
reducing the worst-rank state checkpoint footprint.

This gap follows selection granularity: KDA drops channels within mixed heads, whereas GDN
drops whole heads.

Serving performance.
Figure 3(b,c,e,f) reports three-seed serving means. For KDA, TP-balanced
placement reduces TTFT by 25.4–42.6% and improves input-token throughput by 39.3–68.4%. At
Wmax = 16, DASC-NR reduces TTFT from 567.6 to 326.0 ms and raises throughput from 33.25 to
55.98 k tokens/s. GDN shows a similar trend: at Wmax = 512, DASC-NR reduces TTFT from 614.4
to 374.5 ms and improves throughput from 30.56 to 50.96 k tokens/s. For KDA at Wmax = 512,
an indivisible 113-column head prevents TP balancing from eliminating remote ownership. The
resulting all-to-all communication, combined with longer suffix replay, largely offsets the capacity
benefit in the DASC-WR serving path.

5.4
DASC-WR: ACCURACY–LATENCY TRADE-OFF

All experiments in this subsection use Kimi-KDA; accordingly, Figure 3(g–i) contains only KDA
results. Table 3 reports normal concurrent-serving accuracy. Figure 3(g,h) instead reports replay-
only accuracy from separate strict warm/replay runs. Panel (i) pairs that accuracy with matched-
HBM TTFT, so it is a cross-workload system trade-off rather than a single-run metric.

DASC-NR zero-fills omitted units; DASC-WR instead spends bounded replay compute to refresh
them. Appendix Table 8 isolates the per-hit suffix-refresh cost under fixed slots.

Accuracy recovery.
At Wmax = 128, Figure 3(g) shows that DASC-WR improves all five end-task
estimates over DASC-NR by 0.8–7.4 percentage points. It matches or exceeds Dense on HMMT and
GPQA and remains within 0.7 points on AIME, IMO, and MMLU-Pro.

Figure 3(h) shows the same MMLU-Pro trend: DASC-NR decreases from 66.94% to 60.17% as
Wmax grows, whereas DASC-WR remains at 66.59–67.19%, close to the 67.50% Dense baseline.

Accuracy–latency trade-off.
Figure 3(i) shows a favorable operating point for DASC-NR at
Wmax = 16 as the best trade-off, reducing TTFT by 42.6% with only a 0.56-point accuracy loss.

At Wmax = 128, DASC-WR recovers 4.43 points for 23.0 ms of additional TTFT. At Wmax = 512,
it recovers 7.02 points and remains within 0.31 points of Dense while retaining 25.4% lower TTFT.
Thus, DASC-NR is the default for efficiency, while DASC-WR recovers accuracy under aggressive
compression.

6
LIMITATIONS

We evaluate hybrid architectures only; transfer to purely linear-attention or state-space models re-
mains open. All serving experiments use TP8; scaling to larger TP degrees remains untested. Bene-
fits are also architecture-dependent: GDN exposes head-grained decay and therefore yields smaller
state checkpoint capacity and serving gains than channel-grained KDA, motivating finer-grained
compression for such architectures.

7
CONCLUSION

We presented DASC, combining decay-aware selection, ragged storage, and TP-balanced placement
for hybrid prefix caches. On Kimi-KDA, it remains near dense quality while providing 2.63× state
checkpoint capacity, 42.6% lower mean TTFT, and 68.4% higher input-token throughput under
matched HBM. Suffix replay recovers accuracy at aggressive compression; Qwen-GDN extends
DASC to head-wise decay.

Overall, DASC turns retention heterogeneity into an input-independent state checkpoint policy for
hybrid serving.

ADDITIONAL RETENTION-HORIZON ANALYSIS

A.1
LAYERWISE STRUCTURE

Figures 4–6 retain the architectural ordering removed by Figure 2’s pooled profiles. Their bins match
the tested Wmax values: a unit becomes local when Wmax exceeds its static horizon.

Qwen-GDN varies across heads; Kimi-KDA also varies within heads, supporting the respective se-
lection granularities. Layer-dependent widths motivate ragged storage. These maps are architectural
profiles, not evidence that omitted units are unimportant.

shorter tiers, selecting eight prefixes per tier. For each target T, we first retain conversations with
at least 3.5T characters, tokenize the first 500 eligible candidates, sort them by token count, and
deterministically choose the eight shortest candidates with at least T tokens. If fewer than eight
qualify, the longest available candidates are used. Selected sequences are left-truncated to T tokens,
retaining the final T tokens. Qwen-GDN and Kimi-KDA use the same selected raw conversations
and their own tokenizers; the recorded source-array indices are released with the analysis output.
No random sampling seed is used. Each prefix is processed independently; prefixes are not con-
catenated. We run a full BF16 forward pass through Qwen-GDN (36 GDN layers) and Kimi-KDA
(20 KDA layers), hook the observed token-dependent gates in every linear-attention layer, and
execute the corresponding delta-rule recurrence to obtain the recurrent state and final-query readout
magnitudes. No analysis prefix is used to construct the deployed mask.

Empirical horizons and activity metrics follow Eqs. 4 and 5. The static horizon Hs uses the same
ϵ = 10−3 and representative input a = −0.3 as the serving plan. We calculate Spearman correlations
across units separately for every prefix and layer, then report their median and IQR. This avoids
treating units from different layers or tokens from different prefixes as independent observations.

BUFFER LAYOUT DETAILS

Padded (Scheme 1).
Let Rmax = max1≤l≤L rl, where L is the number of recurrent linear-
attention layers.
For GDN, where one retained unit is a complete head state, the pool
is [L, slots, Rmax, dv, dk].
For KDA, where one retained unit is a (head, k) column, it is
[L, slots, Rmax, dv]. Only the first rl entries of layer l are valid; the remaining entries are padding. A
single wide layer thus pins every layer’s temporal allocation, giving Cpad
temp = (�L
l=1 nl)/(LRmax).
Complete state checkpoint compression additionally includes the BF16 convolution state as in Eq. 6.

Ragged (Scheme 2).
Each layer contributes only its own rl retained units, with offsets o0 = 0 and
ol+1 = ol + rl. GDN uses [slots, �L
l=1 rl, dv, dk], whereas KDA uses [slots, �L
l=1 rl, dv]; layer l
occupies [ol, ol+1). With r = 1

L
�L
l=1 rl, the temporal layout achieves Crag
temp = (�L
l=1 nl)/(Lr).
The retained values match the padded layout, so accuracy is layout-independent. The resulting
temporal-layout gain, Crag
temp/Cpad
temp = Rmax/r, is large when layers are imbalanced—KDA’s per-
channel classification produces one heavy layer and many near-empty ones, whereas GDN’s per-
head global fractions are comparatively even.

DASC: Decay-Aware State Compression for Hybrid Linear-Attention Serving

C
EVALUATION PROTOCOL AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

C.1
SHARED SYSTEM AND STATE CHECKPOINT ACCOUNTING

All formal experiments run in SGLang with tensor parallelism (TP) 8. Model execution and weights
use BF16 without model quantization. Recurrent state checkpoints use SGLang’s default mixed pre-
cision: FP32 temporal state and BF16 convolution state. They use Route A, ragged state checkpoint
storage in the head-aware extra buffer pool, LRU eviction, mem-fraction-static=0.80,
the overlap scheduler disabled, and cache telemetry enabled. Dense is the same cache path with
Wmax = 0, retaining the complete mixed-precision state checkpoint. Across arms, model weights,
tokenizer and chat template, frozen input IDs, prompt hashes, request order, and sampling seeds are
identical.

Matched-HBM serving accounts for the complete recurrent state checkpoint rather than only the
compressed temporal payload. If btemporal
r
(W, m) is the temporal bytes per physical slot on TP rank
r under placement m, and bconv is the native-precision convolution-state footprint, then

The subtraction reserves allocator slot 0. The per-rank budgets are 694,681,600 bytes for Kimi-KDA
and 1,236,271,104 bytes for Qwen-GDN, each equal to 128 dense physical slots and therefore 127
deployable dense slots. Full-attention KV allocation is unchanged across arms and excluded from
the reported state checkpoint compression ratio.

C.2
MATCHED-HBM PERFORMANCE PROTOCOL

For each architecture, the formal matrix contains 25 arms: one dense arm and 4 × 3 × 2 DASC
arms from Wmax ∈{16, 64, 128, 512}, three TP placements, and DASC-NR/DASC-WR. The raw
placements are reported as No TP balancing (off), Storage-balanced control (storage), and
DASC TP-balanced placement (hybrid). The last is an internal DASC placement policy, not a
separate system. Storage-balanced and DASC TP-balanced arms have the same worst-rank bytes
and slot count at a fixed Wmax; their latency difference therefore reflects placement, moved units,
and state checkpoint boundary communication rather than cache capacity.

The controlled reuse-distance workload is derived from all 12,032 MMLU-Pro test prompts and has
six phases: the dense, W = 16, 64, 128, and 512 capacity boundaries, followed by the full dataset.
Boundary target sizes are Qtarget(W) = ⌈Noff(W)/0.85⌉, using the live No-TP-balancing capacity.
This yields 80/36/16/8/4/1 blocks for Kimi-KDA and 80/76/71/59/38/1 for Qwen-GDN. The dense-
boundary phase is replayed six times and each remaining phase once. For every phase, block, and
seed, execution is

flush →untimed streaming cache fill →telemetry →seeded shuffle →timed streaming replay →telemetry.

All arms use concurrency 96, chunked-prefill-size=8192, one deterministic output token,
and request-order seeds {42, 123, 7}. Only replay requests enter the performance metrics. Conse-
quently, this is a controlled cache-fill/replay serving workload that retains queueing, state checkpoint
lookup/load, prefill, and first-token computation; it is not a natural-arrival production trace and does
not measure long-decode throughput.
