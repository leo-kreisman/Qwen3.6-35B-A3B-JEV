## Introduction

So you want to try one of those fancy huge mixture-of-experts (MoE) models locally? Well, whether you've got a gaming PC or a large multi-GPU workstation, we've got you covered. As long as you've downloaded enough RAM beforehand.

## Anatomy of a MoE Model

MoE models are described in terms of their total parameters and active parameters - i.e. DeepSeek V3 671B A37B has 671B total parameters, but we are using only 37B parameters at a time during each forward pass through the model.

In their current form (i.e. DeepSeek V3, GLM 4.X, Kimi K2, Qwen 3 MoE), they contain several major components (for the sake of simplicity):

- Attention
- Dense FFN (optional)
- Shared expert FFN (optional)
- Routed expert FFN
The first three are "always active" in the sense that these model parameters are being used in every forward pass through the model. The last component, the routed experts, take up the vast majority of the model's total size, but we only activate a fraction of these parameters during each forward pass.

## Optimizing CPU offloading in llama.cpp

To achieve optimal performance when splitting between the CPU and GPU, we want to assign all of the "always active" parameters to the GPU. Since we know that we are using these parts of the model for every token generated, it makes sense to keep them on the fastest hardware. We'll assume that you've downloaded a GGUF quantization of your desired model that fits within your combined RAM + VRAM, with a healthy amount of additional space to account for the model's k/v cache, your OS and other running programs, etc. and hop right into the tuning.

A complete launch command might look something like:

```
./llama-server \
-m ./GGUF/GLM-4.7-Q4_K_M.gguf \
-c 32768 \
-ngl 999 \
-fa on \
-t 16 \
-b 4096 \
-ub 4096 \
--jinja \
--no-mmap \
-ot "blk\.([0-9]|[1-2][0-9]|30)\.=CUDA0,exps=CPU"
```

But let's break it down.

### 1. Weight offloading optimizations - maximize token generation speed

(llama.cpp main only) If tweaking weight offloading, disable llama.cpp's auto-fit feature with `-fit off` so you can clearly determine when your configuration runs out of memory. Perhaps in the future, this portion of the guide won't be needed at all once the auto-fit feature is fully optimized.

We first start by assigning all parts of the model to the GPU:

```
-ngl 999
```

This would normally use a huge amount of VRAM, so we'll additionally need to tell llama.cpp to put the routed experts on CPU:

```
-ot "exps=CPU"
```

Or

```
--cpu-moe
```

Putting that together, our launch command is:

```
./llama-server \
-m <path to your model> \
-ngl 999 \
-ot "exps=CPU" \
{{additional launch args as desired}}
```

This is the most basic configuration, with **Attention + Dense FFN + Shared expert FFN** on the GPU along with the model's k/v cache and compute buffer. The remaining **Routed expert FFN** are all assigned to the CPU. Depending on the size of your GPU, you may have a good amount of extra VRAM to spare. We can utilize that space to assign as many layers of **Routed expert FFN** to the GPU as possible. There are two ways to do this.

Using `-ot`, we can manually assign tensors to device using a regular expression:

```
-ot "blk\.([0-9]|[1-2][0-9]|30)\.=CUDA0,exps=CPU"
```

This translates to "assign all tensors from layers 0-9, 10-29, and 30 to the 1st Nvidia GPU" and "assign all routed expert FFN to the CPU". The first statement takes priority, so this results in all **Attention + Dense FFN + Shared expert FFN** as well as the **Routed expert FFN** from layers 0-30 on the first GPU, and the remaining **Routed expert FFN** on the CPU.

Multiple `-ot` expressions are officially recommended to be provided as a comma-separated list, rather than specifying the `-ot` argument multiple times, which is deprecated. Yes, this makes it harder to read, but it ensures compatibility with the env vars used to configure llama.cpp docker.

For simplicity sake we can also specify each layer explicitly:

```
-ot "blk\.(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21|22|23|24|25|26|27|28|29|30)\.=CUDA0,exps=CPU"
```

Or use the built in function:

```
--n-cpu-moe 31
```

**Note**: `--n-cpu-moe` starts counting layers starting from the *highest* numbered layers. This can lead to a slightly discrepancy in how many layers are offloaded because models that have **Dense FFN** layers typically have them at the start of the model (i.e. the first 3 layers of DeepSeek V3).

If you have multiple GPUs, you can specify layers to assign to each device:

```
-ot "blk\.([0-9])\.=CUDA0,blk\.(1[0-9])\.=CUDA1,exps=CPU"
```

This would be "assign all tensors from layers 0-9 to the 1st Nvidia GPU", "assign all tensors from layers 10-19 to the 2nd Nvidia GPU", and "assign all routed expert FFN to the CPU".

Inspect your VRAM usage on each model launch and adjust accordingly via trial and error.

### 2. Prompt processing optimizations

Due to llama.cpp's support for GPU offload prompt processing, where prompt processing is fully delegated to the GPU, CPU+GPU inference is very sensitive to prompt processing batch size. The physical batch size affects how much data transfer to and from the GPU is needed during prompt processing.

Since the GPU has more computing power, it is far more powerful for prompt processing. If you have enough tokens to process together, llama.cpp will perform GPU offload prompt processing (referred to as op offload within llama.cpp), copying all of the CPU-assigned weights over to the GPU to process the prompt tokens as a single batch; this is often faster than letting the CPU handle prompt processing for the portion of the weights assigned to it. In llama.cpp, the default required batch size to trigger this operation is `32` tokens, while in ik_llama.cpp, this threshold is [`32 * total_experts / active_experts`](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/698#issue-3327278619) tokens.

We can configure the maximum number of prompt tokens to batch together by using the `-b` (logical batch size, default `2048`) and `-ub` (physical batch size, default `512`) launch arguments. The defaults are sane for pure GPU inference, however likely too small for CPU+GPU inference of large MoE models. A higher value will require more VRAM usage for the compute buffer, so you may need to reduce the number of routed expert layers assigned to the GPU to accomodate it.

The physical (micro or μ) batch size cannot be larger than the logical batch size, and is the determinant of VRAM usage. Generally we set them both to the same value. I typically recommend `-b 4096 -ub 4096`.

`-mg` can be used to set which GPU will be used as the primary GPU for offloaded prompt processing operations in multi-GPU configurations. This should ideally be your most powerful, highest PCIe bandwidth GPU.

(llama.cpp main only) The environment variable `GGML_OP_OFFLOAD_MIN_BATCH` can be used to override the default threshold of `32` for triggering offloading prompt processing fully to the GPU. If you have low PCIe bandwidth to your GPU, or you have a very large amount of model weights on CPU, `32` is probably too low. For example, if you have 300gb of model weights assigned to CPU, and a PCIe 4.0 x16 connection to your main GPU, this would require a minimum of ~10 seconds to copy the weights to GPU to process a single batch. Your prompt batch likely needs to be at least several hundred for this to be "worth" doing. Jukofyork discusses how to manually determine the break-even point [here](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/17026#issuecomment-3492543006) (note that his instructions use a older proposed name for the environment variable).

(ik_llama.cpp only) The default threshold for triggering GPU offload prompt processing in ik_llama.cpp can be configured via the commandline for the CUDA backend specifically with `-cuda offload-batch-size=32`. My understanding is that for MoE models, this overridden value is still subsequently adjusted by a factor of `total_experts / active_experts`.

## Advanced Topics

### ik_llama.cpp-specific optimizations (by [Geechan](https://rentry.org/geechan))

[ik_llama.cpp](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp) is a fork of an older version of mainline llama.cpp designed around improved CPU/CUDA hybrid performance and new SOTA GGUF quant types, among other things. It is otherwise identical in function to llama.cpp as far as frontend support is concerned.

Because the goal of this guide is to maximise the performance of your CPUmaxx build, it is well worth considering this fork to see if you can eek out further performance improvements, especially with prompt processing speeds. If you use multiple GPUs, the performance improvements can be even more significant. **Note that your mileage may vary depending on your hardware, and in some cases ik_llama may be slower than mainline.**

There are some specific flags that are exclusive to ik_llama that have shown to improve performance, which we will cover here. You can otherwise use the same syntax between llama.cpp and ik_llama.cpp, as described above in the guide.

Before trying out any optimisations, it is strongly advised to use the built-in `llama-sweep-bench` program exclusive to ik_llama to benchmark differences between different flags (substitute `llama-server` for `llama-sweep-bench`). This gives you a human-readable, repeatable output of performance, and will 100% determine what actually improves performance on your system.

**General Flags**

`--merge-qkv` [will merge the Q, K, and V attention tensors together on the attention layers of the model](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/878). This can eek out a decent performance improvement to token generation with effectively no penalty if you've offloaded the attention layers to at least one of your GPUs. Please note this flag will only work if the quantization types of Q, K and V are the same in your quant of choice. This flag will also only work with layer split.

`-gr` will enable [graph reuse](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/947). This can very slightly improve performance depending on the model without any other penalties.

`-smgs` [will enable split mode graph scheduling](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/1068), which is automatically disabled when using tensor overrides. There is a possibility that using this mode with tensor overrides will cause a crash; however, I've found that this isn't always true depending on your hardware setup. Enabling split mode graph scheduling can improve performance by a small but measurable amount, especially notable with graph split mode.

`-mla 3` will enable multi-head latent attention optimisations for models using the DeepSeek architecture (DeepSeek, Kimi K2). If using a model not based on the DS arch, there will be no effect. There are 3 variables you can assign to the command, but for the majority of hardware, `-mla 3` will be your fastest option. `-mla 2` is also worth experimenting with as it can be faster than `-mla 3` with some hardware configurations.

`-amb 512` will determine your max batch size for MLA computations, with 512 being a good medium. This will also only work with models using the DeepSeek architecture. You can experiment with higher numbers between 512-2048; the higher the number, the theoretically faster your performance will be, at the cost of VRAM usage.

**-sm graph**

`-sm graph` (graph split) is a very significant feature exclusive to ik_llama which can greatly improve the performance of multi GPU systems. This does not apply to single GPU systems.

To understand how graph mode split works, it's important to understand how the default layer mode split works first. `-sm layer` will split the tensor layers between your GPUs in an uneven fashion, which is further dictated by your tensor overrides. Layer mode will alternate executing inference on each GPU separately without any parallelization, so you're effectively only ever using the work of *one* GPU at a time. Graph mode split acts like a rudimentary form of tensor parallelism, allowing all your GPUs to crunch inferencing at the same time by splitting the tensors and work evenly across all GPUs.

Note that you will get much better split mode graph performance with a driver that supports direct peer-to-peer access. Installing NCCL (Nvidia Collective Communication Library) may also give a small TG performance boost.

Because of how `-sm graph` works, you will need to modify your `-ot` tensor commands to accommodate an even split between GPUs, otherwise it is likely you will OOM or have suboptimal performance. You will instead want to specify which layers get offloaded to the *CPU* only, while relying on `-ngl 999` to offload the rest of the layers to the GPU evenly.

`-ot "blk\.(19|[2-9][0-9])\.ffn_(up|gate|down)_exps\.weight=CPU"`

This translates to "assign all tensors from layer 19 onwards to the CPU", therefore assigning the beginning 19 layers to your GPUs. It is similar in concept to the prior `-ot` specified in the guide, just in reverse and for the CPU only.

`-sm graph` can greatly improve prompt processing speeds and long-context token generation performance, at the possible expense of the beginning generation speeds before some context has been ingested. `-sas` [can be used to gain back some of that performance](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/1089) depending on your configuration.

### NUMA - multi-socket CPU optimizations

For users with more than one CPU (i.e. dual socket server motherboards), it's worth noting that llama.cpp currently does not handle NUMA elegantly. Allowing llama.cpp to use both CPU sockets and their associated RAM results in degraded performance due to cross-socket memory access. If your model fits within the RAM attached to a single NUMA node, confining it to that node provides the best performance. If not, though, there are some things we can do to reclaim some of that performance.

I've provided two wrapper utility scripts to assist with NUMA configuration, assuming that you have `numactl` installed.

[disable-numa-balancing.sh](https://gist.github.com/DocShotgun/1e4e76b7a67cd44002471022a7561f82) - This script records the current NUMA-balancing state, disables NUMA balancing, then runs any command after it. On quit, it restores the previously recorded NUMA balancing state. The syntax is:

`./disable-numa-balancing.sh <command> [args...]`

[numactl-bind-socket.sh](https://gist.github.com/DocShotgun/9e7147973fbd358f3685794de38fb90b) - This script binds the following command to a single CPU socket (this is useful for hardware with more than one NUMA node per socket). There are additional options to specify whether to bind all cores (including hyperthreads) or physical cores only, and whether to enable memory interleave. For the purposes of llama.cpp, we generally want to interleave if we are using more than one NUMA node, otherwise it doesn't matter. The syntax is:

`./numactl-bind-socket.sh --socket <id> --mode <physical|all> [--interleave <on|off>] <command> [args...]`

For running across all NUMA nodes:

```
./disable-numa-balancing.sh \
numactl --interleave=all \
./llama-server \
--numa distribute \
{{additional launch args as desired}}
```

For binding to a single CPU socket (regardless of how nodes are on each socket):

```
./disable-numa-balancing.sh \
./numactl-bind-socket.sh --socket 0 --mode all --interleave on \
./llama-server \
--numa distribute \
{{additional launch args as desired}}
```

**NUMA "migration" with `drop_caches` + `--mmap` + `--numa distribute`:**

If we drop the page cache (`sudo sh -c "sync; echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"`), and then load the model with `--mmap`, the warm-up pass upon server start will "migrate" tensors to the appropriate node based on threads. This improves TG speed significantly, however it degrades PP speeds when using GPU offload prompt processing. It's possible that the tensors are distributed in a way that makes them less efficient to copy to GPU for prompt processing.

**Using `--direct-io` vs `--no-direct-io`:**

This needs further testing as it may impact the way that tensors are distributed across NUMA nodes on load. Anecdotally, I had faster TG speeds (~14 T/s vs ~12 T/s) with Kimi K2.5 across both sockets with `--no-direct-io`.
